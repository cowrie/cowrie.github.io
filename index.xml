Cowrie, in turn, is maintained by Michel Oosterhof, with whom I really had the pleasure of working these past months.
Whew, that was a mouthful of links, but I&amp;rsquo;ve got my references done with for now&amp;hellip; I have talked about the experience in the official report, so this post will focus a bit more on the technical challenges I faced and my main takeaways, as well as serving to showcase the new features that have been added.</description></item><item><title>Cowrie Honeypot</title><link>https://www.cowrie.org/posts/2015-07-05-cowrie/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.cowrie.org/posts/2015-07-05-cowrie/</guid><description>Since summer 2014 I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on extensions and contributions to the well known Kippo honeypot developed by desaster.
I noticed some SSH attacks against my systems were not logged in full detail and I started to work on additional logging, from there I&amp;rsquo;ve added &amp;lsquo;ssh exec commands&amp;rsquo; support, SFTP support, SCP support, direct-tcpip (proxying) support and many other features.
To distinguish this from the original software, I have now renamed the system to &amp;quot;Cowrie&amp;quot;.</description></item><item><title>Interesting Perl scripts through stdin</title><link>https://www.cowrie.org/posts/2015-02-19-perl-stdin/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.cowrie.org/posts/2015-02-19-perl-stdin/</guid><description>This came in recently in one of my honeypots, same IP address that attempted to download SSH bruteforcing scripts before, but this latest attempt shows a new method of operations. In the log below you can see they attempt to run &amp;lsquo;perl&amp;rsquo;. Kippo accepts the perl command, but we don&amp;rsquo;t see what&amp;rsquo;s executed.
